# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:


```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat init
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npm install create-react-app
npx create-react-app client

npm install dotenv

npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/finalDeploy.js
